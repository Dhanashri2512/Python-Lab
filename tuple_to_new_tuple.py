#Q3) Write a program to copy elements 44 and 55 from the following tuple into a new tuple.
# #for example Tuple1 elements are: (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66)



# Define the original tuple
Tuple1 = (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66)

# Print the original tuple
print("Original Tuple:", Tuple1)

# Create a new tuple with the desired elements
Tuple2 = (Tuple1[3], Tuple1[4])

# Print the new tuple
print("New Tuple:", Tuple2)
